# CanvasOS
This project is dedicated to the creation of a truly free (as in freedom) OS, aimed at empowering individuals, not corporations.

CanvasOS is born from the (anti-user) encroaching of corporate interests upon the world of Free Software.

We stand with Richard Stallman and his original vision of software being beveloped in the open, with the primary goal of improving and aiding mankind as a whole, and not only a few selected parts of it.

Today, that vision has become little more than a mirage: Linux, once a bastion of technological freedom, has been quietly co-opted by large corporations that have shown, time and time again, that their interests do not align with building a better world for all individuals.

In practical terms, CanvasOS is aimed at offering the very best free software, emphasizing the use of native virtualization to allow users the use of proprietary software without compromising their security and privacy. The goal is to offer users a true "canvas", a base with very small resource footprint that can scale from low-powered smartphones all the way to the largest of supercomputers.
