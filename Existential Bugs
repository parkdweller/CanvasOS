Preamble: The "bugs" listed in this section are not software bugs. Rather, they are impediments to the realization of an Operating System aimed at giving the best experience and the most utility to those using it, and not to the corporations behind it. 

1. Github is owned by Microsoft, a company that has proven itself, time and time again, unworthy of the trust of the open source community. We need a better platform to host this project. There is nothing wrong with GitHub per se, but being owned by one of the companies that has caused most harm to the world of software freedom is simply unacceptable. 

2. The Linux Foundation, developers of the Linux Kernel, has been taken over by several large corporations that have been using personal user data to further their own, anti-consumer goals. There is strong evidence that Linus Torvalds, creator and main maintainer of the Linux kernel, an individual beloved by the community for his unwavering commitment to shipping the best software possible, has been run off of the organization by those same corporations, to be substituted by someone more easily controllable. Due to this, it is unclear wether the Linux kernel will continue being the correct choice for user-centric projects. If push comes to shove, we must be willing and able to fork the kernel into something that gives power back to the users.
